### Homework Comments
First thing I noticed is the layout is really clean and neat. And it's cool that you added links for your images.

By the way, there are some tags left behind by a git merge conflict, are you still updating your files?

Here are some areas that you can modify to improve on your website.
- Nearly there with your `<img>` tags, they were just short of the `alt` attributes.

- You might want to avoid  your class sharing the same name with HTML tags (e.g `.img` and `img`) so you don't confuse yourself when writing CSS.

- Lastly, it's a good idea to put your external CSS files into it's own CSS folder. It can be used to contain any additional CSS files in future too.

Good work Sherman!

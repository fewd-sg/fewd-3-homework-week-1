### Homework Comments
I really like the effort you put into the design of the page.

Here are some areas that you can modify to improve on your website.
- You were nearly there with the task of adding images to your website. You just have to include the `alt` attribute to the image tags.

- You can have a **css** and **images** folder to store the respective type of files. It would be neater as you further develop your website in future.

- I noticed the images on your portfolio page is slightly stretched, and that is because the image is not the same aspect ratio as the square size you've given them. You can either specify just the width, and set height to auto like so: `width: 280px; height: auto;` or you could contain each image in a div - [Codepen example](http://codepen.io/ga-sg/pen/KrAKvr) - Note that it relies on positioning which will be covered in later classes.

Nice work Jamie!

### Homework Comments

Here are some areas that you can modify to improve on your website.
- I noticed that you applied many `<br>` tags to space out your elements. You can instead apply spacing with CSS by using the `padding` property.

- I also noticed in the code that you reuse **ID** tags sometimes. Note that **IDs** are meant to be applied only once, so you might consider using a **class** instead.

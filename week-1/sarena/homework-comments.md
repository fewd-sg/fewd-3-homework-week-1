### Homework Comments

I really like your choice of typography in your website. Also saw that you took advantage of stuff not taught yet, like `:before` selector. Cool stuff!

Here are some areas that you can modify to improve on your website.
- I couldn't view the images on your website, as they were not linking correctly (it was linked to an **images** folder).

- You can easily fix this by updating your image links, or by creating **CSS** and **images** folders and putting the respective files in those folders.

- I noticed you made use of shorthands for your CSS rules. Just to share some tips and tricks with you on this.

```css
img {
  margin: 0px 8px 0px 8px;
  /* is the same as */
  margin: 0 8px;
  /* which means top and bottom is 0, left and right is 8px */
  margin: 0 8px 10px;
  /* this means top is 0, left and right is 8px, bottom is 10px */
}
```

### Homework Comments
First thing I noticed about your homework is that the files and code are neatly organised, that's really good practice!

Here are some areas that you can modify to improve on your website.
- On your portfolio page, instead of specifying sizes of the images inline, you can move that code into your CSS file.

- You can also give your `<div>` tags class names so that it's easier to see the nested `<div>` tags apart. Or consider using a list, example below:

```html
<ul>
    <li>
        <img id="1" src="../images/citipix_deliverable.png" alt="Citipix" width="546" height="325">
        <p>CitiPix</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <img id="2" src="../images/startup_matchmaker_deliverable.png" alt="Startup Matchmaker" width="543" height="438">
        <p>Startup Matchmaker</p>
    </li>
  <!-- add more <li> below -->
</ul>
```

Overall, nice work!

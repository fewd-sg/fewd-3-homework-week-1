### Homework Comments
I really liked the layout - especially the fixed sidebar navigation.

I also noticed that you went ahead and used HTML5 tags in place of divs which is good practice (I didn't know the `<mark>` tag existed so that's cool!).

I liked the hover effect on the portfolio images as well, and making use of pseudo-selectors on blockquotes.

Some things you can work on is avoiding the use of inline-styling - like having the `width="90%"` attribute on your image. You can move that into your CSS stylesheet.

Also, you can create a CSS folder to store your `style.css`. It will be neater if you start to add more CSS files in future. Nice work!
